# Folder cleaner
Delete unnecesary files from Abaqus jobs

Include the batch file in a directory of the $PATH to execute it from any other location. For instance, you can paste this file (cleaner.bat) in the directory with Abaqus commands, in my case this is `C:\SIMULIA\Commands`

Then, you can execute anywhere else by running `cleaner` in the command line.
